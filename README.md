## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and locations

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this project, I had an opportunity to build a map component by using a library called Leaflet. Also, I practiced to work with an api to check the IP addresses.

### Useful resources

- [Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - This helped me for using Leaflet with React.
